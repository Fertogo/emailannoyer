# EmailAnnoyer

######EmailAnnoyer allows you to make sure important emails are read by requiring confirmation from the recipient.

Simply type a new email, select the due date and hit send. An email with a uniqe URL will be sent to all users in the database. If a user clicks on the confirmation link, they are done. Otherwise they will receive more and more reminder emails as the due date approaches.  

#####Email Syntax
When typing an email `##NAME##` will be replaced by the recipient's first name. Similarly, `##CONFIRM##` will be replaced with their unique URL.
